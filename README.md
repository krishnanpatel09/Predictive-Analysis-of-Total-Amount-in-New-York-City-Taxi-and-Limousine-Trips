# Predictive-Analysis-of-Total-Amount-in-New-York-City-Taxi-and-Limousine-Trips

Our analysis uses a Kaggle dataset from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), detailing daily trip records, including passenger counts, trip distances, payment types, and fares. Using regression models like decision tree, ridge, lasso, and linear regression, we aim to predict total fares and analyze factors influencing pricing. The research provides insights to optimize pricing strategies, improve service quality, and enhance customer satisfaction in the taxi and limousine industry.

Prediction Model Used:
1. Linear Regression model
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Decision regression tree

Results:
1. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
2. R â€“ Square (Coefficient of Determination)
3. k-fold Cross Validation

Conclusion:
Our research utilized a dataset from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), containing information from over 200,000 license holders and nearly a million daily rides. After cleaning and visualizing the data, we applied regression models, including Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Trees, to predict total fare amounts. Visualization revealed a right-skewed fare distribution, with most trips having lower fares. Among the models, Multiple Linear Regression performed the best, with the lowest RMSE (0.0938) and highest R-squared (0.9905), demonstrating superior accuracy and interpretability. This model offers valuable insights for optimizing pricing strategies, enhancing service quality, and improving customer satisfaction in the transportation industry.
